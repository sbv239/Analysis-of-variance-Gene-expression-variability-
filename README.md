# Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for Gene Expression Variability

This repository contains Python code to perform Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on gene expression data using different approaches. The goal is to assess the variability in gene expression across therapies and verify the consistency of results across various ANOVA methods.

## Overview

ANOVA is used to determine if there are statistically significant differences in gene expression levels between multiple therapies. This repository includes implementations of ANOVA using:

- Scipy's f_oneway: A straightforward approach for one-way ANOVA.
- Statsmodels: A comprehensive approach using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.
- Manual Calculation: Custom implementation of ANOVA calculations.
